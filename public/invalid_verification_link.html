  This page is displayed when someone navigates to a verify email or reset password link
  but their security token is wrong. This can either mean the user has clicked on a
  stale link (i.e. re-click on a password reset link after resetting their password) or
  (rarely) this could be a sign of a malicious user trying to tamper with your app.
